# Lab 25

Today is an optional pair-programming day! If you want to work in a pair, make sure that BOTH participants add the repository to their github account!

The idea for today is to implement a basic little Red Light / Green Light game. You will create several players with different attributes and then play through a game, deciding each round whether the light is red or green. May the best player win!

Due to the flexibility in this assignment, writing tests for it was not going to be simple (or I'd have had to take away all that lovely flexibility!) So you are responsible for making sure everything is working well here yourself!
